## Installation

Our implementation has been tested on ```Python 3.10``` using the libraries from ```requirements.txt```. 

To install the necessary libraries you can use ```pip``` and run the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: You should be able to use slightly different versions for the libraries than the ones we used as long as they are compatible with one another. 

## Code Execution

To execute the algorithms presented in this project you need to run their specific Jupyter Notekooks. You can also copy the code into simple .py files if you wish.

The project is split into 4 different Jupyter Notebooks:
- The Threshold algorithm: ```Threshold Algorithm.ipynb```
- The Fuzzy C-means algorithm: ```Fuzzy C-means Algorithm.ipynb```
- The K-means algorithm: ```K-means Algorithm.ipynb```
- The Evaluation algorithm: ```Evaluation Algorithm.ipynb```
- Inverse_weights regression:```Inverse_weights regression.ipynb```
